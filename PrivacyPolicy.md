### Privacy Policy
Last updated: April 5, 2023

This Privacy Policy explains how QuotesBot ("Bot", "we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, stores, and discloses your information when you interact with the Bot on the Discord platform. By using the Bot, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## 1. Information We Collect
We may collect and process the following types of information when you use the Bot:

* Your Discord server ID
* Your Discord server name
* Your Discord server's text channel ID's
* Your Discord user ID
* Your Discord username and identifier
* Messages sent in your discord server (not including embeds or attachments)
* Messages sent to the bot via Direct Message (DM) (including embeds and attachments)
* Timestamps of messages sent via DM to the bot.

## 2. How We Use Your Information (why we collect this data)
We use the information we collect to:

* Provide the functionality of the Bot
* Respond to support requests and inquiries only from users associated with the relevant data

Specifically

* Your Discord server ID is used to help the bot make quotes specific to your server.
* Your Discord server name may be processed for debugging purposes but will never be stored.
* Your Discord server's channel ID tied to the quotesbot via /setquoteschannel will be stored and used to allow the Bot to know if a message is intended to be a quote or not and to allow the bot to store quotes in this channel. No other channel ID's will be stored.
* Your Discord user ID may be stored if there is a quote attributed to you so the Bot knows who the author of the quote is.
* Your Discord user ID may be stored if you DM the bot to assist with support requests.
* Your Discord username and identifier will not be stored, but may be processed when the bot sends a quote attributed to you in servers with mentions disabled.
* Your Discord username and identifier may be stored when you DM the bot to assist with support requests.
* Messages send in your discord server will only be stored if they are send in a designated qouotes channel and the Bot determines it is a valid quote. In this case, the message will be parsed and only the relevant quote and author will be stored.
* Quotes and authors added using the /quote command or Add to Quotes feature will be stored under this policy.
* Messages sent to the bot via DM will be stored to assist with support requests.
## 3. Data Storage and Retention
We retain your information for only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. You may request a deletion of your data by emailing help@quotesbot.xyz. Stored quotes, user ID's (besides those associated with support requests), server ID's, channel ID's and all other data not associated with support requests will be immediately and irrevocably deleted if the bot is removed from a server.

## 4. Data Sharing and Disclosure
We do not sell, trade, or rent your information to third parties. We may share or disclose your information **only when required by law**.
We take the security of your information seriously and implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of data transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.

## 6. Children's Privacy
The Bot is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will take steps to delete that information as soon as possible.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
